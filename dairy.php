                                <p class="services-details__text-1">Dairy farming involves raising mother animals, including cows,
                                     goats, donkeys, and other livestock, to provide milk for human consumption. Milk, cheese, 
                                     butter, and creams are the most common wholesale dairy products. Dairy farming involves
                                      cattle rearing, milk production, milk processing, product distribution, and management of 
                                      calves. Temperature and humidity are the two main factors that need to be considered in
                                       dairy farming. It is crucial to maintain low temperatures and humidity in order to produce 
                                       high-quality products. Having the right equipment and tools will enable you to maintain the
                                        optimal conditions in dairy farming. </p>

              <p>The word, brand, derives from its original and current meaning as a firebrand, a burning
                piece of wood. That word comes from the Old High German, brinnan and Old English byrnan,
                biernan, and brinnan via Middle English as birnan and brond.[11] Torches were used to
                indelibly mark items such as furniture and pottery, and to permanently burn identifying
                marks into the skin of slaves and livestock. Later the firebrands were replaced with
                branding irons. </p>

            <div class="tab__content-item">
              <p> The marks themselves took on the term and came to be closely associated with craftsmen's
                products. Through that association, the term eventually acquired its current
                meaning. </p>

              <p> Branding and labeling have an ancient history. Branding probably began with the practice

                branding livestock to deter theft. Images of the branding of cattle occur in ancient
                Egyptian tombs dating to around 2,700 BCE </p>

          <p>
            The organizing of information could be seen since humans began to write. Prior to that, history
            was passed down only through song and word.[citation needed] As can be seen with religion, books
            and spoken word, science (through journals and studies) organizing not only is history but also
            supports the communication of history.

              <p> A market analysis studies the attractiveness and the dynamics of a special market within

                special industry. It is part of the industry analysis and thus in turn of the global
                environmental analysis. Through all of these analyses, the strengths, weaknesses,
                opportunities and threats (SWOT) of a company can be identified. Finally, with the help
                of a
