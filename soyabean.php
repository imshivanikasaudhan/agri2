                                <p class="services-details__text-1">Sugarcane is an environmentally friendly crop, 
                                    as it requires very little fertilizer and pesticides. Sugarcane draws essential 
                                    nutrients from the region's fertile and moist soil. Sugarcane fields produce
                                     food and also provide valuable habitat for animals. The juice squeezed from 
                                     sugarcane is high in both water and sugar content. This delicious liquid is 
                                     then extracted and transformed into sugar through a careful process. The 
                                     cultivated sugarcane, processed into sugar, contributes to the production of
                                      bread, canned fruits and vegetables, energy bars, beverages, cereals, cakes,
                                     ice cream, and various other beloved food products.</p>

              <p>The word, brand, derives from its original and current meaning as a firebrand, a burning
                piece of wood. That word comes from the Old High German, brinnan and Old English byrnan,
                biernan, and brinnan via Middle English as birnan and brond.[11] Torches were used to
                indelibly mark items such as furniture and pottery, and to permanently burn identifying
                marks into the skin of slaves and livestock. Later the firebrands were replaced with
                branding irons. </p>

            <div class="tab__content-item">
              <p> The marks themselves took on the term and came to be closely associated with craftsmen's
                products. Through that association, the term eventually acquired its current
                meaning. </p>

              <p> Branding and labeling have an ancient history. Branding probably began with the practice
                of
                branding livestock to deter theft. Images of the branding of cattle occur in ancient
                Egyptian tombs dating to around 2,700 BCE </p>

          <p>
            The organizing of information could be seen since humans began to write. Prior to that, history
            was passed down only through song and word.[citation needed] As can be seen with religion, books
            and spoken word, science (through journals and studies) organizing not only is history but also
            supports the communication of history.

              <p> A market analysis studies the attractiveness and the dynamics of a special market within
                a
                special industry. It is part of the industry analysis and thus in turn of the global
                environmental analysis. Through all of these analyses, the strengths, weaknesses,
                opportunities and threats (SWOT) of a company can be identified. Finally, with the help
                of a
                SWOT analysis, adequate business strategies of a company will be defined</p>

              <p>Analysis is the process of breaking a complex topic or substance into smaller parts in

                relatively recent development.</p>
