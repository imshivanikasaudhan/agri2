                                     beets, radishes, turnips, parsnips, and rutabagas. These are cool-season crops with a long storage life.
                                      Root crop farming involves processes such as soil preparation, planting, irrigation, weed control, 
                                      pest management, and harvesting. Root crops are grown in well-drained, loose soil with a pH between
                                       6.0 and 6.5. They require shallow cultivation
                                     and weeding when they are small to prevent competition for water and mineral nutrition.</p>

              <p>The word, brand, derives from its original and current meaning as a firebrand, a burning
                piece of wood. That word comes from the Old High German, brinnan and Old English byrnan,
                biernan, and brinnan via Middle English as birnan and brond.[11] Torches were used to
                indelibly mark items such as furniture and pottery, and to permanently burn identifying
                marks into the skin of slaves and livestock. Later the firebrands were replaced with
                branding irons. </p>

            <div class="tab__content-item">
              <p> The marks themselves took on the term and came to be closely associated with craftsmen's
                products. Through that association, the term eventually acquired its current
                meaning. </p>

              <p> Branding and labeling have an ancient history. Branding probably began with the practice

                branding livestock to deter theft. Images of the branding of cattle occur in ancient
                Egyptian tombs dating to around 2,700 BCE </p>

          <p>
            The organizing of information could be seen since humans began to write. Prior to that, history
            was passed down only through song and word.[citation needed] As can be seen with religion, books
            and spoken word, science (through journals and studies) organizing not only is history but also
            supports the communication of history.

              <p> A market analysis studies the attractiveness and the dynamics of a special market within
                a
                special industry. It is part of the industry analysis and thus in turn of the global
                environmental analysis. Through all of these analyses, the strengths, weaknesses,
                opportunities and threats (SWOT) of a company can be identified. Finally, with the help
                of a
                SWOT analysis, adequate business strategies of a company will be defined</p>

              <p>Analysis is the process of breaking a complex topic or substance into smaller parts in
