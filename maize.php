                                <p class="services-details__text-1">Known as the "queen of cereals," Maize has the greatest
                                     genetic yield potential among all cereals. Maize serves as a basic raw material in a 
                                     wide range of industrial goods while serving as a staple food. These include starch, 
                                     oil, protein, alcoholic beverages, food sweeteners, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, films, 
                                     textiles, gums, packaging, and paper, etc. Maize farming involves several key steps such 
                                     as land preparation, irrigation, fertilization, etc. As 
                                    farmers are embracing the latest technologies, maize cultivation continues to evolve.</p>

              <p>The word, brand, derives from its original and current meaning as a firebrand, a burning
                piece of wood. That word comes from the Old High German, brinnan and Old English byrnan,
                biernan, and brinnan via Middle English as birnan and brond.[11] Torches were used to
                indelibly mark items such as furniture and pottery, and to permanently burn identifying
                marks into the skin of slaves and livestock. Later the firebrands were replaced with
                branding irons. </p>

            <div class="tab__content-item">
              <p> The marks themselves took on the term and came to be closely associated with craftsmen's
                products. Through that association, the term eventually acquired its current
                meaning. </p>

              <p> Branding and labeling have an ancient history. Branding probably began with the practice
                of
                branding livestock to deter theft. Images of the branding of cattle occur in ancient
                Egyptian tombs dating to around 2,700 BCE </p>

          <p>
            The organizing of information could be seen since humans began to write. Prior to that, history
            was passed down only through song and word.[citation needed] As can be seen with religion, books
            and spoken word, science (through journals and studies) organizing not only is history but also
            supports the communication of history.

                environmental analysis. Through all of these analyses, the strengths, weaknesses,
                opportunities and threats (SWOT) of a company can be identified. Finally, with the help
